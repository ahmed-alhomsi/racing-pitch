                <h1>Progression</h1>
                <p>Adding a good progression system with a risk for reward system is key to keeping the player entertained. An intuitive way of earning experience and money in game. It is one of the things Need For Speed Heat has been known for, the game offered earning experience by racing during the night which increased the risk of getting into a police pursuit, the higher the heat level rises, the more the player gains exp for it, but if the player gets caught, all of that exp is gone. That’s what keeps the players on edge, the edge is what keeps the player going. So setting up events types that provide exp with a risk for reward mechanic is what we need. We need to make the players feel like they are rising from the bottom to the top, that’s what brings satisfaction and makes the player want to achieve higher and higher. Now this could be done in the way the player earns money, car parts, or even cars.</p>
                <p>As for the story, the game will follow a story of an established racer, who lost his career after an accident, none of the teams in the racing scene wanted him anymore and then he tries to build his own crew, racing as a lone wolf and gathering people to join him along and race the leaderboards to the top. There will be competition and enemies that will 0try their best to put hurdles in the players path.</p>
                <p>Now in the beginning there will only be non team races, but after a certain amount of exp, the players will get their first crew member which will then unlock team races, and later on as the crew gets bigger, the player can unlock more team related races and championships. Each crew member will have a special ability, be it drafting, or repairing your car on the fly, now this is an arcade racer, so we can let our imagination fly sky high.</p>
                <p>The way the player can earn exp is by competing certain milestones or challenges within the races or any other event type.</p>
