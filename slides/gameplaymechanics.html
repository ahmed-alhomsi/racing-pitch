                    The gameplay mechanics will be the same as any other racing title to date, follow the road, first to the finish wins. But besides the game will contain car customization, a full day and night cycle, damage on collision, drifting and one of the most important one’s would be online leaderboards and multiplayer. We would also include special events as seen in Forza Horizon series with hot wheels race tracks and racing against trains and fighter jets. Along with The Crew 2 which consists of events such as stunt driving and so on and so forth with their own story behind each event. Now another thing following all of these will be adding different event types. Circuit races, Endurance races, Championships and Drag races with their own separate tracks along with story events similar to Need For Speed ProStreet. The game will also consist of a system where the players can choose to transform their car’s handling according to their desired play style whether it be grip or drift upor a sweet spot in the middle, this will be achieved with a system of switching car performance parts and tweaking their parts such as tyre pressure. The higher the pressure, the more grip loss and more drift; the lower pressure, more grip and lower drift. Similar to what Forza does, but since we’re on a smaller scale arcade game, we can keep it simple to just using sliders and not values.

                    Now with all of this there will be certain special event types that would be different than the usual race events. What I mean by that is that we will have events such as what we saw in Watch Dogs where we had to mow down hoards of zombies with our car and score points. Along with it we can add Blur inspired races, using power ups to win races.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There will be team races with different powers for each team member that participates in the race with the player, something similar to what Juiced and Need For Speed Carbon offers.

                    Multiplayer is absolutely key to making the game feel alive. In the past decade, every single top rated racing game has come out with online multiplayer. Players in this genre love to challenge real life players, it gives the players a sense of dominance against the others. This all comes from watching movies from the racing genre, it makes the players feel badass. Playing against the computer is a thing of the past, people want a real challenge against other players.
