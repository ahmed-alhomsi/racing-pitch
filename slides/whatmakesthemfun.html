                <h1>What makes a racing game fun</h1>
                <p>
                    I was reading a few research papers over the use of AI in the track & map generation in games and why such methods have not been yet implemented in racing games.
                    Although besides that there were a few things that did tell us about what makes a racing game fun based on the responses from a group of non expert individuals, or as we could call them, average joes. According to them what makes a racing game fun is
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex">
                <ul>
                    <li>-The sense of speed, feeling that you’re going fast. Now most of how these are achieved, I'll come back to them later.</li>
                    <li>-Driving endlessly on a straight track isn’t fun.</li>
                    <li>-Crashing all the time isn’t fun either, meaning, it’s a racing game, no matter how much we might think that adding more traffic will add more realism is fun, in reality it is not. Although if implemented correctly, with countermeasures included for the player to use to weave through the traffic would be fun.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>-A good challenge, no rubberbanding, actual AI performance.</li>
                    <li>-Drifting is a fun mechanic, although if used too much can become a real annoyance really fast.</li>
                    <li>-Good tracks, with a good approach to the five essential metrics;
                    Race Line, Track Width, Camber, Clipping Points, Height Variation as mentioned in a research article</li>
