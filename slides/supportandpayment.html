                <p>
                    This is one of the most crucial sections in this whole presentation. This will be the key to getting positive attention towards the studio and maximizing profits. For this section I will use The Crew 2 as the leading example. The Crew 2 has received the best press when it comes to it's payment model. The game offers free dlc forever, the main method the way The Crew 2 makes its profits is by selling vanity items, something exactly like fortnite, but never before done in a game from this genre. The game was 60 USD at launch and rightly so for its scale, it offered bikes, cars, boats, planes, hovercrafts, cars with discipline for off roads, tracks and streets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But since we are on a smaller scale, we can have the price lower after the early access, during and before which the game will be free to try. Post launch we will roll out free content updates with new cars and tracks and environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is exactly what other studios have not done and this is exactly what the crew 2 was praised and other games were frowned upon.
