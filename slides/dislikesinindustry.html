                <h1>Dislikes in the industry</h1>
                <p>Now before we start understanding what the game will consist of and how it will play out, we need to learn some if not most of the things that the communities around racing games dislike.</p>
                <p>The first culprit being the lack of content. Within the first few months of the release cycle, developers just abandon the game and soon after it becomes starved of content resulting in many unhappy players and just in general abandonment. The Crew 2 on the other hand, hasn’t done that and it churns out new content every week be it in the form of new cars or tracks or events. That has led it to have a consistent player base even after 4 years after its release.</p>
                <p>Drifting, drift to steer became a really popular trend in racing games back in 2012-2015 and it was nice to have at first, but became a major annoyance for the players. Players wanted a choice of both grip and drift based handlings, just as too much of something becomes really annoying.</p>
                <p>Limited car customization, a lot of players have had this problem with Forza games with the lack of customization options. What generally is offered in Forza games is one body kit and that’s it, nothing to give your car a personal touch.</p>
                <p>Lack of lore or story. I have noticed that many racing games that lack a storyline be it as simple as explaining how to work your way around the game or just in general as to why you’re there racing in the first place have been the most likely ones to be forgotten early on. Forza has its own music festival which is the reason why you race in that game. Every need for speed game has had a story even though people didn’t like them, but still the player base stuck with them longer.</p>
